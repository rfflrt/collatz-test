# Collatz Conjecture Testing

This code was requested informally on a MAC0110 class lessoned by Roberto Hirata, 1st semester of 2024. I did not code it when requested, but decided to do it on the recess.

Initially, it'd only received a natural number N and printed all resulting numbers (because it looks cool on Python's IDLE), counting the number of iterations.
A statistics undergraduate friend of mine, Eduardo Yukio, asked me to graph the results of the number of iterations from 1 to N, so I did it. Also, I altered the initial code to graph the result of every iteraction using pyplot.

The Collatz's Conjecture states that the sequence generated by a certain function applied to every natural number (0 not included) will converge to 1.

The sequence com be written as:
$x_{n+1} = \frac{x_n}{2}$ if $n$ is even;
$x_{n+1} = 3x_n + 1$ otherwise.

That is, if a number is even, its sequent is its half and, if odd, is its tripple plus 1.
